## Helping to pick the best real estate listing photos

### Project Motivation

The world we live in today is a digital one and searching for a home is no different. The typical buyer searches for properties online by checking websites with images of a house. Most of the websites(zillow, trulia, realtor.com and others) are structured in a way that potential buyer will first see only one image of a listed house and that is why it is extremely important to select that picture wisely. Many sellers (homeowners, real estate agents, brokers...),however, do not pay enough attention to the quality of a listing photos of a houses so, the goal of my project is to help sellers is to pick the best photos of their houses to make them look more attractive for home buyers.

### Dataset
I had 2 options to collect the relevant data for my project:

Extract data from websites.
Use existing datasets.
I could not extract enough data from the websites because of their security measures so I decided to search for existing datasets. I found two good datasets on Kaggle and Github:

Github - https://github.com/emanhamed/Houses-dataset.git

Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal

After analyzing both of them, I have decided to continue with Github dataset. Even though it contains smaller number of pictures (2,136) compare to one from Kaggle (15,000), I chose Github dataset because, unlike the other one, it has 4 images for each house ( bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and a frontal image of the house) which is exactly what I need for my project because not only the front image of a house can be the most attractive part of a listed property.
